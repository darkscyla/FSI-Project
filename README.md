# FSI-Project
A generic solver for really basic coupling problems

## Objective
The aim of this project was to make a generic small scale solver which uses lagrange coupling to couple different domains.
Currently, the static cases are solved using CoupledDomain.py where as Dynamic cases use CoupledDomain2.py
To see how to use the functionality, see testCases
